;; iSHARE JWT payload data specs

;; FEEDBACK: the following is incorrect: iss and sub are not always
;; equal and may not be client-id. For instance, delegation evidence
;; is issued by AR server for client.

;; From https://dev.ishareworks.org/reference/jwt.html#jwt-payload
;;
;;   "The JWT payload MUST conform to the private_key_jwt method as
;;    specified in OpenID Connect 1.0 Chapter 9.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST always contain the iat claim.
;;
;;    The iss and sub claims MUST contain the valid iSHARE
;;    identifier (EORI) of the client.
;;
;;    The aud claim MUST contain only the valid iSHARE identifier of
;;    the server. Including multiple audiences creates a risk of
;;    impersonation and is therefore not allowed.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST be set to expire in 30 seconds. The combination of
;;    iat and exp claims MUST reflect that. Both iat and exp MUST be
;;    in seconds, NOT milliseconds. See UTC Time formatting for
;;    requirements.
;;
;;    The JWT MUST contain the jti claim for audit trail purposes. The
;;    jti is not necessary a GUID/UUID.
;;
;;     Depending on the use of the JWT other JWT payload data MAY be
;;     defined."

;; From  OpenID Connect 1.0 Chapter 9.
;; https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication
;;
;; private_key_jwt Clients that have registered a public key sign a
;; JWT using that key. The Client authenticates in accordance with
;; JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication
;; and Authorization Grants [OAuth.JWT] and Assertion Framework for
;; OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization
;; Grants [OAuth.Assertions]. The JWT MUST contain the following
;; REQUIRED Claim Values and MAY contain the following OPTIONAL Claim
;; Values:
;;
;;     iss
;;
;;         REQUIRED. Issuer. This MUST contain the client_id of the
;;         OAuth Client.
;;
;;     sub
;;
;;         REQUIRED. Subject. This MUST contain the client_id of the
;;         OAuth Client.
;;
;;     aud
;;
;;         REQUIRED. Audience. The aud (audience) Claim. Value that
;;         identifies the Authorization Server as an intended
;;         audience. The Authorization Server MUST verify that it is
;;         an intended audience for the token. The Audience SHOULD be
;;         the URL of the Authorization Server's Token Endpoint.
;;
;;     jti
;;
;;         REQUIRED. JWT ID. A unique identifier for the token, which
;;         can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens
;;         MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were
;;         negotiated between the parties; any such negotiation is
;;         beyond the scope of this specification.
;;
;;     exp
;;
;;         REQUIRED. Expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST
;;         NOT be accepted for processing.
;;
;;     iat
;;
;;         OPTIONAL. Time at which the JWT was issued.
